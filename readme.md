### About

"Human speaking through a bot" is a proof-of-concept of a two chat bots logically connected with each other.Â One is a public and receive messages from everyone, second is private and forward messages from all users talking with a public one. Most importantly, private bot can forward messages back to a specific user of public bot. So the user would talk with an administrator through a bot identity.

[`single`](https://github.com/valiafetisov/human-speaking-through-a-bot/tree/single) branch has a realisation of single bot being public and private at the same time using login/logout sistem for administrators.
