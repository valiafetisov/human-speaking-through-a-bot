### About

"Human speaking through a bot" is a proof-of-concept of a two chat bots logically connected with each other.Â One is a public and receive messages from everyone, second is private and forward messages from all users talking with a public one. Most importantly, private bot can forward messages back to a specific user of public bot. So the user would talk with an administrator through a bot identity.
